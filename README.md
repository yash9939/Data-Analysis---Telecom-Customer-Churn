# Data-Analysis---Telecom-Customer-Churn

Introduction of Customer_Churn :-

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers end their relationship with a company or service provider, typically by canceling their subscriptions or contracts and moving to a competitor or discontinuing the service altogether.

In this analysis, I am working with the "Telecom-Customer-Churn.csv" dataset, which contains information related to customer churn in a telecom company. The dataset includes various attributes such as customer demographics, services subscribed, contract details, and churn status. We aim to explore factors influencing customer churn and visualize patterns using Python's Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn/Matplotlib for data visualization.

In my analysis of telecom customer churn using the "Telecom-Customer-Churn.csv" dataset, I've streamlined my data by removing unnecessary columns. This process ensures we focus only on the most relevant factors influencing customer retention and satisfaction.
